The Sat/Sun dinner is the same as breakfastâ€¦ rolls, bread, rice cakes with meat, cheese and diverse spreads. We plan to have food available at the snack bar all day long, but only plan to keep out the refrigerated toppings and spreads during breakfast and dinner meal times. There is a common kitchen available to overnight participants and a kitchenette available to day participants.
