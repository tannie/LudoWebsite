Cross-Gen Mario Kart Tournament
-------------------------------

"It's a me, Mario!" We'd like to invite you to join us for a Cross-Gen Mario Kart tournament!

GameCube Qualifying Rounds: Contestants will play 4-player races of Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart: Double Dash (GameCube)

Mario Kart 64 Semi Finals: The top 4 players from the Wii and Double Dash races will compete in a Mario Kart 64 (Nintendo 64) Grand Prix w/ the top 2 players advancing to the Finals.

Super Mario Kart Finals: The top 2 players will play a Grand Prix of Super Mario Kart on Super Nintendo to determine the tournament winner!

The tournament is just for fun, but maybe we'll get lucky and find some prizes too. :)
