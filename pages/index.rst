Ludo is an event held at the Esperanto-Stacio in Halbe (just outside Berlin) on 6-9 September 2024. This will be an extended videogame weekend in which we'll play everything from modern to retro game systems. For example, we'll play VR together on the Meta Quest 3 and local multiplayer on the Xbox Series S. Enjoy a 2-player modern dance pad experience similar to Dance Dance Revolution. As for retro, we'll have systems from Pong to Nintendo GameCube. We also have a 4K projector on a 150" screen for an epic local multiplayer gaming experience that's hard to get anywhere else!
