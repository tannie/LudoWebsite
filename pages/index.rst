Stay tuned for info about Ludo 2025!

Ludo is an annual event held at the Esperanto-Stacio in Halbe (just outside Berlin) from 2021-2024. This is an extended videogame weekend where we play everything from modern to retro game systems. For example, we play VR together on the Meta Quest 3 and local multiplayer on the Xbox Series S. Enjoy a 2-player modern dance pad experience similar to Dance Dance Revolution. As for retro, we have systems from Pong to Nintendo GameCube. We also have a 4K projector on a 100" screen for an epic local multiplayer gaming experience that's hard to get anywhere else!

`MashTec <https://manuelschoeneberge2.wixsite.com/meinewebsite>`_ embarked on a journey into the world of retro gaming handhelds in late 2019 and early 2020. Starting with the RG350—a popular clone of the GCWzero—he delved into the rabbit hole of these nostalgic devices. His familiarity with Linux from work led him to share his findings on YouTube, creating the `MashTec channel <https://www.youtube.com/@MashTec>`_.

As the pioneer who introduced EmulationStation and RetroArch to these handhelds through his explanation videos, MashTec’s influence quickly spread. Manufacturers like Anbernic and Powkiddy adopted these tools for their upcoming devices. But for Manuel, it’s not just about software—it’s about pushing boundaries, reviewing devices, and sharing improvements with the community.
