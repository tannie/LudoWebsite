There is hostel-style accomodation on-site with 2-4 beds per room and attached bathroom/shower to every room, so you can basically wake up, go downstairs and start gaming already. Light breakfasts and dinners will be included and lunch will be organized at local restaurants, included in the price. If you want to stay longer, it will also be possible to stay up to 2 nights before/after the event (â‚¬30/night).

Health rules: It is currently impossible to know in advance what any health rules will be at the time of writing this registration form, but we will be following local Brandenburg regulations.

Organizers: Chuck Smith (RG Geek), Tanja Orme
